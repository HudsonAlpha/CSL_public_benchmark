# References
This folder contains reference genome metadata necessary to re-create the references we currently test.
All references are based on hg38, meaning the coordinate system for the main chromosomes _should_ all be identical.
The primary differences in these references comes down to masked sequences in the primary chromosomes, ALT contigs, and ALT contig mappings.
